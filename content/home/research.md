<b>Ocean and Global Climate</b>

Methane seeps in the deep ocean lead to methane release to the atmosphere, which may impact the global climate. With [**Dr. Peiyuan QIAN**](https://life-sci.ust.hk/team/pei-yuan-qian/) in HKUST, I coupled omics of eDNA and isotopes of seawater, sediments, and carbonates in the methane seep environments to understand how microbial communities have driven the methane release from the seafloor at geological time scales. 

I also conducted the most advanced omics to investigate the unexplored genes with commercial use potential from the eDNA of the deep ocean biomass.  

<b>Microbial Ecology Related To Hydraulic Fracturing Water Cycle</b>

During my Ph.D. with [**Dr. Danial S. Alessi**](http://alessilaboratory.com/), I conducted the microbial communities' metagenomics research in the deep fractured subsurface to understand the impact of microbial communities on energy production. I also researched the impacts of flowback and produced water on soil and aquifer microbial community compositions and functionalities. I applied the most recent machine learning techniques to find novel bioindicators of the flowback and produced water contaminants.
